# coding-exercises
This repository is my implementation of useful and common data structures, algorithms, solutions to programming puzzles, as well as machine learning algorithms.  
For each algorithm and problem, I write at least two approaches, one naive and one efficient approach, with their corresponding big-O analysis.  
The code is written in Python 3.
